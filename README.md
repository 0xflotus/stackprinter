## Python stack formatter

This prints detailed Python stack traces, with some more source context and with current variable contents. It's a quick way to see what your code is doing when you don't have an IDE or even a debugger for some reason, like when your only debugging tool is a log file ðŸ˜±

# Usage

## Logging exception tracebacks
Call `show` or `format` inside an except block for a traceback of the currently handled exception. `show` prints to stderr, `format` returns a string.

By default, either will generate plain text. Pass `style='color'` to get some semantic highlighting. See the docs of `format` for all the config options.

```python
import stackprinter

try:
    something()
except:
    stackprinter.show()  # grab the current exception and print a traceback to stderr

    # ...or only return a string, e.g. for logging.
    message = stackprinter.format()
    logging.log(message)
```
There's also `stackprinter.set_excepthook` which replaces the default python crash message (so it works automatically without manual try/except... unless you're in IPython).

You can also pass exception objects explicitly.

## Printing the call stack of another thread
Pass a thread object to `show` or `format`.

```python
thread = threading.Thread(target=something)
thread.start()
while True:
    stackprinter.show(thread) # or format(thread)
    time.sleep(0.1)
```

## Printing the call stack of the current thread
Call `show` or `format` outside of exception handling.

```python
stackprinter.show() # or format()
```

## Tracing a piece of code as it is executed

More for curiosity than anything else, you can watch a piece of code execute step-by-step, printing a trace of all calls & returns 'live' as they are happening. Slows everything down though, of course.
```python
tp = stackprinter.TracePrinter(style='color', suppressed_paths=[r"lib/python.*/site-packages/numpy"])
tp.enable()
a = np.ones(111)
dosomething(a)
tp.disable()
```

# How it works

Basically, this is a frame formatter. For each [frame on the call stack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_stack), it grabs the source code to find out which source lines reference which variables. Then it displays code and variables in the neighbourhood of the last executed line.

Since this already requires it to know where each variable occurs in the code, there was really no way around also adding the colorful semantic highlighting thing seen in the screenshots. These colors are ANSI escape codes now, but it should be fairly straightforwardâ„¢ to render the same frame representation without any 1980ies terminal technology. Say, a foldable and clickable HTML page with downloadable, pickled variables. But for now you'll have to pipe the ANSI strings through [ansi2html](https://github.com/ralphbean/ansi2html/) or something.

# Caveats

This displays variable values as they are _at the time of formatting_. In
multi-threaded programs, variables can change while we're busy walking
the stack & printing them. So, if nothing seems to make sense, consider that
your exception and the traceback messages are from slightly different times.
Sadly, there is no responsible way to freeze all other threads as soon
as we want to inspect some thread's call stack (...or is there?)
